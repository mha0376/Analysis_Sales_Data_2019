# Analysis_Sales_Data_2019

This project analyzes sales data from 2019 to identify trends and insights.  While the original repository lacked a description, this README provides comprehensive documentation to facilitate understanding and use.

## Features and Functionality

This project performs the following analyses on sales data:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and inconsistencies within the dataset.  (Specific cleaning techniques should be documented here once the code is reviewed.)
* **Sales Trend Analysis:** Identifies overall sales trends throughout the year.
* **Product Performance Analysis:** Analyzes the performance of individual products or product categories.  (Specific metrics analyzed, e.g., total sales, average sales, etc., should be added here.)
* **Sales by Region/Location:** (Details on geographical breakdown of sales data and analysis performed need to be added here if present in the code.)
* **Visualization:** Generates charts and graphs to visualize the analysis results (Specific visualization libraries and chart types should be detailed once the code is analyzed.)

## Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** (Determine and list the programming language used.  Python is a likely candidate given the nature of the project.  Check the files.)
* **Libraries/Frameworks:** (List any data analysis libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn etc.  This needs to be populated after reviewing the code.)
* **Data Storage:**  (Specify how the data is stored, e.g., CSV files, databases, etc.  Look for file extensions within the repository.)

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x:**  (Specify the minimum required version if known.)
* **(List necessary libraries here):** `pip install <library_name>` for each required library. (This needs to be populated after reviewing the code and identifying dependencies.)


## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mha0376/Analysis_Sales_Data_2019.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Analysis_Sales_Data_2019`
3. Create a virtual environment (recommended): `python3 -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    * **Linux/macOS:** `source venv/bin/activate`
    * **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (A `requirements.txt` file should be created listing all project dependencies.  This file should be added to the repository.)


## Usage Guide

1. **Data Preparation:**  (Describe the process of preparing the data for analysis. Mention file paths or specific data loading procedures.)
2. **Running the Analysis:** (Explain how to run the analysis scripts.  Provide specific command-line instructions if applicable, e.g., `python analysis_script.py`.)
3. **Output:** (Describe where the output (e.g., reports, visualizations) is generated and in what format.)


## API Documentation (if applicable)

(Add API documentation if the project exposes any APIs. This section would be unnecessary if this is purely data analysis.)
